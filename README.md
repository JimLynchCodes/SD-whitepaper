Early designs and ideas for the stop dropper tool.


## Why?

I made this tool for myself becuase I realized that I would spend a ton of time using my broker's clunky tools.

The purpose of this tool was to make creating and adjusting __my own___ stop orders super fast and easy, and I'm excited to share this platform for others to use as well.

<br/>

## How?

This platform exposes a unique and expressive control system that allows you to modify a set of stop orders in just a few easy clicks.

But before we get into all that, let's define some terms.

<br>

## A "Stop Ladder" Example

Let's suppose we are trading SPY, and we have three shares.

We can create a series of stop market sell orders with stop prices below the current price, and our broker's servers will be automatically watching for you and will trigger the market sell order if the price of SPY drops down to there.

<br/>

## Why Are Stop Ladders Useful?

Setting stop limit orders is a risk management strategy that protects you against large losses.

The idea is that as your profit goes down, the size of your position goes down, and therefore your overall risk goes down.

This technique allows traders to have peace of mind with a "worst case maximum loss" much lower than the full investment.

You're betting on a direction, and if you're wrong then these stop order will automatically cut your losses and you can just move on without having to make any difficult, emoptional decisions later on when you're down.
